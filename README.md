Cartoonizer with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for applying a cartoon effect to images using OpenCV. The script utilizes a Cartoonizer class with methods for rendering cartoon-style images. The cartoon effect is achieved through a combination of bilateral filtering, adaptive thresholding, and other image processing techniques.

Features:
Cartoonization: Transform your images into a cartoon-like style with vibrant edges and reduced details.
OpenCV: Utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing tasks.
Preservation of Aspect Ratio: Resizes images to a fixed width and height while maintaining the original aspect ratio, preventing distortion.
Easy to Use: Simply provide the input image file name, and the script generates and displays the cartoonized version.
Instructions:
Install the required dependencies: OpenCV and NumPy.
Run the script by providing the input image file name.
View the original image, edges, and the cartoonized version.
Feel free to customize the script to suit your preferences or integrate it into your own projects. Experiment with different parameters to achieve unique cartoon effects.
